Galaxy datatypes for NCBI BLAST+ suite (OBSOLETE)
=================================================

These Galaxy datatypes are copyright 2010-2014 by Peter Cock (The James Hutton
Institute, UK) and additional contributors including Edward Kirton, Nicola
Soranzo, and Bjoern Gruening.

See the licence text below.

Note that these files (and the associated BLAST+ wrappers) were originally
distributed as part of the main Galaxy repository, but as of August 2012 moved
to the Galaxy Tool Shed as 'blast_datatypes' (and 'ncbi_blast_plus' for the
wrappers). My thanks to Dannon Baker from the Galaxy development team for his
assistance with this.

The datatypes returned to the main Galaxy repository and were including in the
October 2016 release. There have been minor changes there since. These copies
are now obsolete.

It is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/blast_datatypes


History
=======

These versions numbers initially matched those for 'ncbi_blast_plus', but are
not used explicitly in the datatypes themselves.

Version Changes
------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.11 - Final revision as part of the Galaxy main repository, and the
          first release via the Tool Shed
v0.0.13 - Uses ``blast.py`` instead of ``xml.py`` to define the datatypes
v0.0.14 - Includes datatypes for protein and nucleotide BLAST databases
          (``blastdbp`` and ``blastdbn``, based on work by Edward Kirton)
v0.0.15 - Fixes a MetadataElement bug and includes more of the optional
          BLAST database files (contribution from Nicola Soranzo)
v0.0.16 - Adopt standard MIT License.
        - Use reStructuredText for this README file.
        - Development moved to GitHub, https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast
        - Nucleotide database definition aware of MegaBLAST index superheader
v0.0.17 - Add ``maskinfo-asn1`` and ``maskinfo-asn1-binary`` sub-datatypes
          (contribution from Nicola Soranzo)
v0.0.18 - Add retries to BLAST XML merge code.
        - Modify display_data method to allow unit tests to function.
v0.0.19 - Add ``blastdbd`` datatype for BLAST protein domain databases, for use
          with makeprofiledb and rpsblast (contribution from Bjoern Gruening).
        - Add ``pssm-asn1`` datatype for Position Specific Scoring Matrices
          (PSSMs) stored in NCBI's "scoremat" ASN.1 format (usually named
          as ``*.smp``), used as input files for makeprofiledb.
v0.0.20 - Added "NCBI BLAST+ integrated into Galaxy" preprint citation.
v0.0.21 - Updated citation information with GigaScience paper.
v0.0.22 - Removed unused imports in ``blast.py`` (internal change only).

Installation
============

Doing this automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed is probably simplest.


Manual Installation
===================

Normally you would install this via the Galaxy ToolShed, which would move
the provided ``blast.py`` file into a suitable location and process the
``datatypes_conf.xml`` entries to be combined with your local configuration.

However, if you really want to this should work for a manual install. First
update the ``datatypes_conf.xml`` file in the Galaxy main folder by inserting
the contents of the ``<registration>`` and ``<sniffers>`` sections from the
small ``datatypes_conf.xml`` file provided in the tar-ball.

For the ``<registration>`` section you would add several ``<datatype ... />``
lines, one per new datatype::

    <datatype extension="blastxml" type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastXml" mimetype="application/xml" display_in_upload="true"/>
    ...

Similarly, some of the new dataypes have ``<sniffer ... />`` lines used to
automatically recognise the datatype when uploaded into Galaxy::

    <sniffer type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastXml"/>
    ...

Also create the file ``lib/galaxy/datatypes/blast.py`` by moving, copying or linking
the ``blast.py`` file provided in this tar-ball.  Finally add ``import blast`` near
the start of file ``lib/galaxy/datatypes/registry.py`` (after the other import
lines).

Developers
==========

These BLAST+ datatypes and associated tools were originally developed on the
following hg branch: http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

As of July 2013, development is continuing on a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the ``blast_datatypes`` folder::

    $ tar -czf blast_datatypes.tar.gz README.rst datatypes_conf.xml blast.py

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf blast_datatypes.tar.gz
    README.rst
    datatypes_conf.xml
    blast.py

For development, rather than having a local ToolShed running, I currently
use a symlink from ``lib/galaxy/datatypes/blast.py`` to the actual file as
described above.
