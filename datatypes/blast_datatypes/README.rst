Galaxy datatypes for NCBI BLAST+ suite
======================================

Note that these files (and the associated BLAST+ wrappers) were originally
distributed as part of the main Galaxy repository, but as of August 2012 moved
to the Galaxy Tool Shed as 'blast_datatypes' (and 'ncbi_blast_plus' for the
wrappers). My thanks to Dannon Baker from the Galaxy development team for his
assistance with this.

It is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

History
=======

These versions numbers initially matched those for 'ncbi_blast_plus', but are
not used explicitly in the datatypes themselves.

Installation
============

Doing this automatically via the Galaxy Tool Shed is probably simplest.


Manual Installation
===================

Normally you would install this via the Galaxy ToolShed, which would move
the provided blast.py file into a suitable location and process the
datatypes_conf.xml entry to be combined with your local configuration.

However, if you really want to this should work for a manual install. Add
the following lines to the datatypes_conf.xml file in the Galaxy main folder::

    <datatype extension="blastxml" type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastXml" mimetype="application/xml" display_in_upload="true"/>
    <datatype extension="blastdbn" type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastNucDb" mimetype="text/html" display_in_upload="false"/>
    <datatype extension="blastdbp" type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastProtDb" mimetype="text/html" display_in_upload="false"/>

and later in the sniffer section::

    <sniffer type="galaxy.datatypes.blast:BlastXml"/>

Also create the file lib/galaxy/datatypes/blast.py by moving, copying or linking
the blast.py file provided in this tar-ball.  Finally add 'import blast' near
the start of file lib/galaxy/datatypes/registry.py (after the other import
lines).

Developers
==========

BLAST+ datatypes and wrappers, and other tools were originally developed on the
following hg branch: http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

As of July 2013, development is continuing on a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the blast_datatypes  folder::

    $ tar -czf blast_datatypes.tar.gz README.rst datatypes_conf.xml blast.py

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf blast_datatypes.tar.gz
    README.rst
    datatypes_conf.xml
    blast.py

For development, rather than having a local ToolShed running, I currently
use a symlink from lib/galaxy/datatypes/blast.py to the actual file as
described above.
