Galaxy datatype definitions (OBSOLETE)
======================================

For a time, the Galaxy community shared additional datatypes on the
Galaxy Tool Shed. Since the October 2016 release of Galaxy, our NCBI
BLAST XML and database datatypes returned to the Galaxy core.

Each sub-folder represented a different entry on the Galaxy ToolShed,
for example ``blast_datatypes`` contains definitions for BLAST specific
file types such as BLAST XML and BLAST databases.

For general information, see the `main README file <../README.rst>`_.
