Galaxy Tool sample data
=======================

This folder contains sample files used by Galaxy tools defined elsewhere
in this repository. For example, ``blastdb_p.loc.sample`` is a sample
file used to generate the default ``blastdb_p.loc`` file describing any
system-level protein BLAST databases available within Galaxy.

For general information, see the `main README file <../README.rst>`_.
