Galaxy dependency definitions
=============================

Each sub-folder represents a different entry on the Galaxy ToolShed,
for example ``package_blast_plus_2_2_26`` defines the BLAST+ 2.2.26
dependency which can be used by other Galaxy ToolShed entries.

For general information, see the `main README file <../README.rst>`_.
