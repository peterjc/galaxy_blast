description: Maps BLAST results to GO annotation terms
long_description: |
  Galaxy wrapper for Java command line tool Blast2GO for pipelines, b2g4pipe v2.5,
  available from http://blast2go.org/

  The tool takes a single BLAST XML file as input, searched against a protein database
  such as the NCBI non redundant database (NR). The tool gives a single tabular output
  file, the annotation file which can be opened with the Blast2GO GUI.

  The wrapper uses a Galaxy loc file to allow the use of one or more Blast2GO property
  files (e.g. different versions of the database, or different servers, or different
  evidence weighting settings). We use this to offer both a local Blast2GO database
  (fast) and the public database hosted in Valencia, Spain.
