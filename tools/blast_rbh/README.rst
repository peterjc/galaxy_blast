Galaxy tool to find BLAST Reciprocal Best Hits (RBH)
====================================================

This tool is copyright 2011-2014 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script to run reciprocal BLAST searches on a
pair of sequence files, and extract the reciprocal best hits.

This is a work in progress, and builds on an earlier implementation which
prequired the two BLAST searches be prepared in advance. Integration allows
a much simpler user experience, and can ensure sensible filters are used.


Automated Installation
======================

Installation via the Galaxy Tool Shed should take care of the Galaxy side of
things, including the dependency the NCBI BLAST+ binaries.


Manual Installation
===================

There are just two files to install:

- ``blast_rbh.py`` (the Python script)
- ``blast_rbh.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in a ``tools/blast_rbh/`` folder. You will then
need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool
by adding the line::

    <tool file="blast_rbh/blast_rbh.xml" />

If you want to run the functional tests, include the same line in your
``tool_conf.xml.sample`` file, and the sample test files under Galaxy's
``test-data/`` directory. Then::

    ./run_functional_tests.sh -id blast_reciprocal_best_hits

You will need to have the NCBI BLAST+ binaries installed and on the ``$PATH``.


History

======= ======================================================================
Version Changes
------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1.0  - Initial Test Tool Shed release, targetting NCBI BLAST+ 2.2.29
v0.1.1  - Supports self-comparison, sometimes useful for spotting duplicates.
v0.1.2  - Using optparse for command line API.
        - Tool definition now embeds citation information.
        - Fixed Tool Shed dependency definition.
v0.1.3  - Option to make FASTA files non-redundant (via Biopython dependency).
        - Avoid extra database and BLAST search in self-comparison mode.

Developers
==========

This tool is developed on the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast/tree/master/tools/blast_rbh

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder::

    $ tar -czf blast_rbh.tar.gz tools/blast_rbh/README.rst tools/blast_rbh/blast_rbh.xml tools/blast_rbh/blast_rbh.py tools/blast_rbh/tool_dependencies.xml test-data/rhodopsin_nucs.fasta test-data/rhodopsin_proteins.fasta test-data/three_human_mRNA.fasta test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta test-data/k12_edited_proteins.fasta test-data/k12_ten_proteins.fasta test-data/rbh_megablast_rhodopsin_nucs_vs_three_human_mRNA.tabular test-data/rbh_blastn_three_human_mRNA_vs_rhodopsin_nucs.tabular test-data/rbh_blastp_four_human_vs_rhodopsin_proteins.tabular test-data/rbh_none.tabular test-data/rbh_tblastx_rhodopsin_nucs_vs_three_human_mRNA.tabular test-data/rbh_blastp_k12.tabular test-data/rbh_blastp_k12_self.tabular
