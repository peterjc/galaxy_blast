Galaxy tool to extract top BLAST hit descriptions from BLAST XML
================================================================

This tool is copyright 2012-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script to parse a BLAST XML file, and extract the
identifiers with description for the top matches (by default the top 3), and
output these as a simple tabular file along with the query identifiers.

It is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:
http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/blastxml_to_top_descr

This requires the 'blast_datatypes' repository from the Galaxy Tool Shed
to provide the 'blastxml' file format definition.


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically install the
'blast_datatypes' dependency.


Manual Installation
===================

If you haven't done so before, first install the 'blast_datatypes' repository.

There are just two files to install (if doing this manually):

* blastxml_to_top_descr.py (the Python script)
* blastxml_to_top_descr.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/ncbi_blast_plus next to
the NCBI BLAST+ tool wrappers.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. e.g. next to the NCBI BLAST+ tools. Simply add the line::

    <tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_top_descr.xml" />

To run the tool's tests, also add this line to tools_conf.xml.sample then::

    $ sh run_functional_tests.sh -id blastxml_to_top_descr

Version Changes
------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.1  - Initial version.

          on the 'blast_datatypes' repository in the Tool Shed.
v0.0.3  - Include the test files required to run the unit tests
v0.0.4  - Quote filenames in case they contain spaces (internal change)
v0.0.5  - Include number of queries with BLAST matches in stdout (peek text)
v0.0.6  - Check for errors via the script's return code (internal change)
v0.0.7  - Link to Tool Shed added to help text and this documentation.
        - Tweak dependency on blast_datatypes to also work on Test Tool Shed
        - Adopt standard MIT License.
v0.0.8  - Development moved to GitHub, https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast
v0.0.9  - Updated citation information (Cock et al. 2013).
v0.0.10 - Update help text to mention BLAST+ 2.2.28 can produce tabular files
          including the description/title (via the salltitles field).
v0.1.0  - Switch to using an optparse based API for Python script internally.
        - Support BLAST XML with multiple ``<Iteration>`` blocks per query.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were originally developed on the 'tools' branch of
the following Mercurial repository: https://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/

As of July 2013, development is continuing on a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the GitHub repository root folder::

    $ tar -czf blastxml_to_top_descr.tar.gz tools/blastxml_to_top_descr/README.rst tools/blastxml_to_top_descr/blastxml_to_top_descr.* tools/blastxml_to_top_descr/repository_dependencies.xml test-data/blastp_four_human_vs_rhodopsin.xml test-data/blastp_four_human_vs_rhodopsin_top3.tabular test-data/blastp_four_human_vs_rhodopsin_converted_ext.tabular test-data/blastp_four_human_vs_rhodopsin_top3_positive.tabular

Check this worked::

    $ tar -tzf blastxml_to_top_descr.tar.gz
    tools/blastxml_to_top_descr/README.rst
    tools/blastxml_to_top_descr/blastxml_to_top_descr.py
